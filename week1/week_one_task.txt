Advantages of Agile Methodology.
1. Improved statkeholder engagement to deliver high quality working software.
2. Allow project teams to respond to customer reaction and constantly improved the product.
3. Agile is highly transparent. Every one related in the project has visibility to WIP.
4. New features are delivered quickly and frequently with a high level of predictability.
5. In Agile the cost is predictable and is limited to the amount of work that can be done by the team.
6. There is an opportunity to constantly refine and reprioritize the overall product backlog.
7. Allow project teams to have acute fucus on the business value and customer needs.
8. Agile allow for better control over project due to it transparency and quality contol.
9. Agile implementation reduces the chances of the product delivering lower output or failing.
10. Agile team have increased autonomy and autority over their decisions.

Disadvantages of Agile Methodology
1. Less concrete planning: Agile is framed around a boxed approach and priorities are constantly
   changing. This makes it hard to nail down a set delivery date on project.
2. Intense commitment: Agile development only work well when the entire development team is 
   committed to the project for the duration
3. Team member wear many Hats: Agile team members must be knowledgeable about a variety of processes
4. Final product can differ: Since the initial Agile plan might not be set, the actual final product 
   can vary greatly from what was proposed.
5. Limited documentation: Most often than not in Agile teams, documentation tend to get sidetracked,
   which makes it harder for new member to get up to speed.
